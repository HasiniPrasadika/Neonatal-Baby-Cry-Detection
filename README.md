- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive Streamlit web application
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides caring advice based on predictions

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) - 40 coefficients
- **Dataset**: DonateACry Corpus with 5 cry categories
- **Performance**: ~85-90% accuracy on test set

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the DonateACry corpus containing:
- **Belly Pain**: Cries indicating stomach discomfort

### Training the Model

```python
from train_model import BabyCryDetectionTrainer

# Initialize trainer with your data path
trainer = BabyCryDetectionTrainer("/path/to/your/data")

# Run complete training pipeline
trainer.run_training_pipeline()

# Make predictions
predicted_class, confidence = trainer.predict_single_audio("test_audio.wav")
print(f"Predicted: {predicted_class} (Confidence: {confidence:.4f})")
```

### Using the Web Application

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This is an AI assistant tool and should **not replace professional medical advice**
- Always consult healthcare providers for serious concerns about your baby
- The model provides probabilistic predictions, not definitive diagnoses
- Accuracy may vary based on recording quality and background noise

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model not loading**: Ensure all .pkl files are in the project directory
2. **Audio not recording**: Check microphone permissions in browser
3. **Low accuracy**: Ensure audio quality is good and crying is prominent
4. **Installation errors**: Verify Python version and try updating pip

### Performance Tips

- Use high-quality audio recordings (clear, minimal background noise)
- Record for at least 2-3 seconds to capture sufficient audio features
- Ensure the baby's cry is the dominant sound in the recording
- Test with different microphone positions for optimal results
- Consider the environment - quiet rooms work best
